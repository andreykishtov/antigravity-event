### whats bad in vibe coding:
- context blindness is the biggest risk
llm dont have context so double code happends alot.

### whats good in vibe coding:
new features , product qa session, code base refactoring, mock data generation. product prototyping.

what learned from this project:

first rule: * tech design is the most important part of the project - everything should be explicit.
second rule: * prompting for tech design.
third rule: * write prompts in Jiras.

- ask question from llm and to ask you questions for the task.
-  one centrulize file for all agents.
- write every change that was done in md file and this is the source of truth.
- לנהל את מסמך וסיכום שדברים קראו בדרך.
- not to much context.


# agenting work flow.

task -> development -> deployment

trello mcp  -> in trello url for figma -> check if works in browser. 

walkthrough -> https://jules.google/ is for creating.

run gemini cli -> git hub activity -> md files on how to do code review and he return the answers for the questions.

- ask agent to do summery of completed work and send it part of PR.
