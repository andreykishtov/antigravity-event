# antigravity-event

Meta prompting, composability

sub agents.

deep agents - have  planning tools sub agents and file system and can call other deep agents.

## How to create a vibe codding product

1. created a vision

2. started with whatsapp message.

wanted to get done in 1.5 months.

tech desigh i agent builder event.

in 3 days have all the database and live service ready.
in one day finished the ui.
and in 2 days there was a workflow ready.
in one week after that there was a agent builder ready.
wapi infra tool for voice.

in 2 weeks after that theree was a agent builder ready.
wapi infra tool for voice.

also home page done and transcription events.

### whats bad in vibe coding:
- context blindness is the biggest risk
llm dont have context so double code happends alot.

### whats good in vibe coding:
new features , product qa session, code base refactoring, mock data generation. product prototyping.

what learned from this project:

first rule: * tech design is the most important part of the project - everything should be explicit.
second rule: * prompting for tech design.
third rule: * write prompts in Jiras.

- ask question from llm and to ask you questions for the task.
-  one centrulize file for all agents.
- write every change that was done in md file and this is the source of truth.
- לנהל את מסמך וסיכום שדברים קראו בדרך.
- not to much context.


# agenting work flow.

task -> development -> deployment

trello mcp  -> in trello url for figma -> check if works in browser. 

walkthrough -> https://jules.google/ is for creating.

run gemini cli -> git hub activity -> md files on how to do code review and he return the answers for the questions.

- ask agent to do summery of completed work and send it part of PR.

## Context Rot:
 1. error enters history.

sulution context md.

- /memory

 - context prunning. לנקות את הקונטקסט

remove unused files.

 - 200 tokens summery for gemini.

 - write context , check which conetxt to send , compress context , sub agents.

 AI SDLC workshop.

 - claude code log.

 - manage token when using mcps, they give too much tokens.

 - template sub agent for claude code.

- code review in IDE for dev, code review in github using agent, human review

- prepush code review

# deep comentation:
deep wiki for deep comentation.

https://deepwiki.com/microsoft/vscode

- knowledge curation

- there whatsup builder groups. as he said it is .

- planing meeting?

Stagest of coding
- we are not still in vibe coding state.
- agent mode vibe coding. man i the llop

gemini goes to -> multi agent god mode:

one man show. paralel agents.

## Base44 questions:

- less tokens is better than creation using JS event better here.

toon: https://dev.to/sreeni5018/toon-vs-json-a-modern-data-format-showdown-2ooc

- 3 delevelopers in early startup of base44
- wix founder was meeting with base44 founder -> and they thinked what to do next.
- 15 people work on base44 startup.
- monolith and use gemini.
- the most important path is simplicity. abstruction of levels , seperation of concerns. - base44 sdk.
rich hicky simple made easy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4
paraxelance. - https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_excellence

agenting loop.
- keep it simple stupid.

evals production. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iN-cPnp7xg&t=1s

change to system prompt is needed because there is no need to evals.

evals is too slow for moving code.

churn

sentiment analysis and conversion -> if we did something bad.

clariry for users. do fear to deploy.
evals is not good enough. summary of talk.

feedback loop is not good enough for now -> create test plan and planing with PRD.
text to app -> framework.

a question is b2b vs b2c?. b2c by marketing strategy. but its to b2b.


## SOC-MAS: mutli-agent SOC workflow.

A2A - agent to agent.

need to work on set of instructions for LLM.


## Best Practices for Agentic Coding.

1. settings.json

what cli can do and can't do.

they say its better to disable .gitignore rules.


2. google want to add .geminiignore

3. gemini.md
system istruction of gemini cli.

/init -

memomize - add context to gemini.md. 

Gemini CLI hirarchy is key because he doesn't know upper folders.

1. https://dotgemini.dev
2. https://geminicli.com/extensions

checkpoints in gemini.

context managment context - /compress when history is long.

custom event that saves specific text that i want to save.

### pre planning - specific place to put plan.

creation of milestones.

plan.md - create a plan of what to do

tracking.md - is a place to talk about planing with agents.

1. pre planing.
2. post planing.

tracking.md

long file.

how to do: read progress file and lets work.
